# Code Coverage Excuses

## Main
- manage.py  
    - This file is Django's executable file and not written by us. The code that is not covered is checking for an import error (which will not happen in our product as all packages will be installed at time of setup).
  
- classscribe/settings.py  
    - This file is auto-generated by Django and is effectively a serialized data log for some dependencies and pertinent information of our codebase rather than actual project logic that is run. The code that is not covered checks for an import error, this time for Heroku, which will not happen since our product is packaged and deployed on Heroku where it is accessible.

- Professor/models.py, Student/models.py, custom_admin/models.py  
    - The 1 line of code not covered in each of these files is due to a bug in the testing suite, Coverage.py. For some reason, the method that returns a string representation of an object is not being covered, despite our tests.py testing that method. You can see this in Professor/tests.py on line 93, Student/tests.py on line 14, and custom_admin/tests.py on line 30.

- LE/capture.py
    - There is an exception that is not being covered in the code because we cannot reasonably test it without exceeding our maximum upload quota for our Google Cloud account. Rest assured, the exception is just an error message.
