*NOTE* you will be able to use the above URL to test all the features in the user manual that do not require a Raspberry Pi. Because of ease of deployment/speed, we used the server link http://128.143.67.97:44104 in the last few weeks of development and stored our example data there (which you can access using username: rm4mp@virginia.edu password: 1234). You can be assured that our codebase is EXACTLY the same on heroku as the server, therefore our installation instructions are valid and the product is available at the heroku link as requested by the customer. However, our preloaded data is on the server for you to test and evaluate.
